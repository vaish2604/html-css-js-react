    <h1>My Indian Food Bucket List</h1>
    <ul>
        
        <img src="./Chole" alt="Chole Bhature, Delhi" height="200" width="200">
        <li>
            <p>Delhi – Chole Bhature</p>
            <p>A North Indian favorite, Chole Bhature is a hearty breakfast or brunch dish. The chole is a spicy chickpea curry flavored with onions, tomatoes, ginger, garlic, and a blend of garam masala, cumin, and coriander. The bhature is deep-fried, soft yet slightly chewy bread made from refined flour. Served hot with pickled onions, tangy achar (pickle), and sometimes a glass of sweet lassi, it’s filling and full of flavor.</p>
        </li>
        
        <img src="./Rosogolla.jpg" alt="Rosogolla, Kolkata" height="200" width="200">
        <li>  
            <p>Kolkata – Rosogolla</p> 
            <p>Soft, spongy balls of chhena (cottage cheese) and semolina dough, gently boiled in light sugar syrup until they soak up the sweetness. Originating in West Bengal, rosogolla has a melt-in-the-mouth texture and a subtle sweetness that’s less intense than many other Indian sweets. Served chilled, it’s especially refreshing in hot weather.</p>
        </li>
        
        <img src="./hyderabad-biryani.jpg" alt="Hyderabadi Biryani"height="200" width="200">
        <li> 
        <p>Hyderabad – Hyderabadi Biryani:</p>  
        <p> A fragrant rice dish rooted in the royal kitchens of the Nizams. Made by layering basmati rice with marinated chicken or mutton, fried onions, saffron, fresh herbs, and aromatic spices, then slow-cooking (dum method) to seal in the flavors. Served with mirchi ka salan (a tangy chili curry) and raita, it’s a feast for both aroma and taste</p>
        </li>
        
        <img src="./vadapav.jpg" alt="Vada Pav, Mumbai" height="200" width="200">
        <li> 
            <p>Mumbai – Vada Pav:</p>
            <p>Known as the “poor man’s burger,” vada pav is Mumbai’s most iconic street food. A spiced mashed potato patty coated in gram flour batter is deep-fried to golden perfection, then placed inside a pav (soft bread roll) with tangy tamarind chutney, spicy green chutney, and sometimes a fried green chili for an extra kick. Quick, cheap, and addictive.</p>
        </li>
        

        <img src="./amritsar-lassi.jpg" alt="Lassi, Amritsar".>
        <li>
            <p>Amritsar – Lassi:</p>
        <p>A thick yogurt-based drink that’s more like a dessert in Punjab. The sweet version is blended with sugar, sometimes cardamom, and topped generously with malai (fresh cream). The salty version is seasoned with roasted cumin, black salt, and fresh herbs. Served in tall clay or steel glasses, it’s perfect for cooling down in the summer heat.</p>
        </li>

        
        <img src="./ahmedabad-dhokla.jpg" alt="Dhokla, Ahmedabad" height="200" width="200">
        <li>   
            <p>Ahmedabad – Dhokla:</p>
            <p>A light, fluffy steamed snack from Gujarat made from a fermented batter of chickpea flour (besan) and rice flour. After steaming, it’s topped with a tempering of mustard seeds, green chilies, and curry leaves, then garnished with fresh coriander and grated coconut. Soft, tangy, and slightly sweet, it’s enjoyed as breakfast or an evening snack.</p>
        </li>

        
        <img src="./goa-fish-curry.jpg" alt="Goan Fish Curry" height="200" width="200">
        <li>  
            <p>Goa – Goan Fish Curry:</p>
        <p>A coastal delicacy made with fresh local fish simmered in coconut milk, turmeric, red chilies, and tangy kokum or tamarind. The flavors are bold yet balanced — spicy, tangy, and creamy. Served with steamed rice, it’s a staple in Goan homes and beach shacks, best enjoyed fresh by the seaside.</p>
